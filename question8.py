# TypeScript book documentation context
TYPESCRIPT_DOCS = """
The TypeScript Book Documentation:

Fat Arrow Functions:
The author affectionately calls the => syntax the 'fat arrow'. This is a shorthand syntax for function expressions in TypeScript and JavaScript. It provides a more concise way to write function expressions.

Boolean Conversion Operator:
The !! operator (double bang or double negation) converts any value into an explicit boolean. It uses double negation to coerce a value to its boolean equivalent. The first ! converts the value to boolean and inverts it, the second ! inverts it back to the correct boolean value.

TypeScript Compiler API:
The node.getChildren() method lets you walk every child node of a ts.Node in the TypeScript compiler API. This is useful for traversing the Abstract Syntax Tree (AST).

Trivia in TypeScript:
Code pieces like comments and whitespace that aren't in the AST are called 'trivia'. Trivia includes formatting details that don't affect code execution but are important for maintaining the original source code format.
